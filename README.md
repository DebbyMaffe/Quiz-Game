# Quiz-Game using File handling

Let's create **Text Files** for the first time, one for each *question* of the quiz, and manage their content. 
Each File contains the *question* text on the first row, the number of the *correct answer* on the second line, and the *multiple choices* on the remaining rows. 

Once text files have been handled, let's create the Graphical User Interface by using the **Tkinter** package for python. In particular, we are going to insert:
* the **entry** widget to get *input* from the user;
* the **messagebox** widget to *display* a message or a warning;
* the **menu** widget consisting on the list of *choices* that appears only after the user clicks on the menubar;
* the **button** widget to trigger any *actions*.
